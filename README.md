[![GitHub Issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/SarugaAlen/AHP_Method.svg)](https://github.com/SarugaAlen/AHP_Method/issues)

## Description

This is a C# WPF desktop application that utilizes the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method to assist in decision-making. The AHP method is a multi-criteria decision-making technique that allows users to systematically evaluate and prioritize alternatives based on a set of criteria. This application provides a user-friendly interface for creating decision hierarchies, inputting criteria and alternatives, performing pairwise comparisons, and generating final rankings.

## Features

- User-friendly interface: The application offers an intuitive and visually appealing user interface built with WPF, ensuring a seamless user experience.
- Decision hierarchy creation: Users can easily create decision hierarchies by defining criteria and alternatives, establishing relationships, and setting priorities.
- Pairwise comparisons: The AHP method relies on pairwise comparisons to determine the relative importance of criteria and alternatives. This application enables users to input and compare the elements efficiently.
- Consistency check: To ensure the validity of the decision-making process, the application performs consistency checks based on the entered pairwise comparison matrices.
- Calculation of final rankings: The AHP method calculates the overall rankings of the alternatives based on the established priorities. This application generates clear and concise rankings for informed decision-making.
- Chart visualization: The application utilizes the LiveCharts WPF library to display charts and visual representations of the decision hierarchy, criteria comparisons, and alternative rankings. This enhances the understanding and interpretation of the decision-making process.
