## Description

This is a C# WPF desktop application that utilizes the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method to assist in decision-making. The AHP method is a multi-criteria decision-making technique that allows users to systematically evaluate and prioritize alternatives based on a set of criteria. This application provides a user-friendly interface for creating decision hierarchies, inputting criteria and alternatives, performing pairwise comparisons, and generating final rankings.

## Features

- User-friendly interface: The application offers an intuitive and visually appealing user interface built with WPF, ensuring a seamless user experience.
- Decision hierarchy creation: Users can easily create decision hierarchies by defining criteria and alternatives, establishing relationships, and setting priorities.
- Pairwise comparisons: The AHP method relies on pairwise comparisons to determine the relative importance of criteria and alternatives. This application enables users to input and compare the elements efficiently.
- Consistency check: To ensure the validity of the decision-making process, the application performs consistency checks based on the entered pairwise comparison matrices.
- Calculation of final rankings: The AHP method calculates the overall rankings of the alternatives based on the established priorities. This application generates clear and concise rankings for informed decision-making.
